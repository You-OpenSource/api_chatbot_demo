# Repo Info
## Poetry
We use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) as our dependency manager.
The link above has great documentation but there is a TL;DR.

- Install the package: `poetry install`
- Add a dependency: `poetry add <python-lib>`
- Where are dependencies specified? `pyproject.toml` include the high level requirements. The latests exact versions installed are in `poetry.lock`.

## Streamlit
We use [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for the interface. 

Streamlit is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create and share custom web apps for machine learning and data science. 

Here are [the docs](https://docs.streamlit.io/).
