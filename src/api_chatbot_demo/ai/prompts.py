We currently offer 2 [You.com](http://You.com) APIs. Smart mode and Research Mode:

- Smart Mode: quick, reliable answers for a variety of questions
- Research Mode: in-depth answers with extensive citations for a variety of questions

Each API endpoint is designed to generate conversational responses to a variety of query types, including inline citations and web results when relevant.

### API Details

- Endpoints:
    - Smart Mode: `https://chat-api.you.com/smart`
    - Research Mode: `https://chat-api.you.com/research`
- Authorizations:
    - X-API-KEY (required)
- Query Parameters:
    - query (required): a string to generate a response
    - chat_id (optional): a random string for ongoing conversations
- Response: JSON format

```jsx
{
    'answer': str,
    'search_results': [
            {
                'url': str,
                'name': str,
                'snippet': str,
            },
            ...
    ]
}
```

### Inline Citations Details

- Smart Mode: Cites the entire web page URL.
- Research Mode: Cites the specific web page snippet relevant to the claim.

## Retrieving a response for a chat

```python
import requests

headers = {'x-api-key': <YOUR_API_KEY>}
endpoint = "https://chat-api.you.com/smart" # use /research for Research mode

params = {"query": "what is the solar eclipse"}
response = requests.get(endpoint, params=params, headers=headers)
print(response.json())
```

## Streaming the events (recommended for Research Mode)

We support streaming the events as soon as they are available. This is recommended for Research Mode, which will take a longer time than Smart Mode.

The example below makes use of sseclient-py to parse the streamed events. You can also use other SSE clients or parse the events from the server yourself.

```python
# pip install sseclient-py
import sseclient
import requests
import json

headers = {'x-api-key': <YOUR_API_KEY>}
endpoint = "https://chat-api.you.com/research" # Use /smart for Smart mode

params = {"query": "what is the solar eclipse", "stream": True}
response = requests.get(endpoint, params=params, headers=headers, stream=True)
client = sseclient.SSEClient(response)
full_answer = ""
for event in client.events():
    print(f"{event.event}: {event.data}")
    if event.event == "search_results":
        search_results = json.loads(event.data)
    elif event.event == "token":
        full_answer += event.data
    elif event.event == "error":
        pass
    elif event.event == "done":
        pass

print(full_answer)
```    

## Retrieving responses within a multi-turn conversation
We also provide the ability to use conversational history to power multi-turn conversations. Below is an example of creating a unique chat id and then attaching the chat id to subsequent requests in order to continue a conversation.

```python
import requests
import uuid

headers = {'x-api-key': <YOUR_API_KEY>}
endpoint = "https://chat-api.you.com/smart"

chat_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
params = {"query": "where did obama graduate from?", "chat_id": chat_id}
response = requests.get(endpoint, params=params, headers=headers)

params = {"query": "when was he born?", "chat_id": chat_id}
response = requests.get(endpoint, params=params, headers=headers)
print(response.json())
# The API response: Barack Obama was born on August 4, 1961.
```

### What are the main differences with Smart Mode API vs WebLLM?

- Smart Mode API is much higher quality. On an external study, Smart Mode API responses were preferred over WebLLM (RAG) API responses ~77% of the time.
- Smart Mode API provides in-response citations
- Smart Mode API provides web results, with URL and snippets (in addition to an answer)
- Smart Mode API is conversational, allowing a developer to specify a chat_id to continue a conversation
- Smart Mode API supports streaming. The API sends updates to the client as soon as an event happens, instead of needing the full response to be generated. This allows faster real-time data processing and faster visible responses to end users.

### How much does the Smart Mode API cost?

For existing customers, there is no price difference. For new customers, the cost will be $11 CPM.

### How does Smart Mode API perform vs WebLLM?

Overall, we've found that Smart Mode API is preferred over WebLLM 77% of the time by independent raters evaluating a range of queries. We believe this is an under-estimate since our raters did not consider formatting nor citations for various reasons. Both of these enhancements should further improve Smart Mode API performance in real world scenarios.

### What QPS does Smart Mode API Support?

We can support a range of QPS. For now, if you intend to send more than 100 QPM (Queries Per Minute), please let us know.


Focus on ONLY the you.com API and it's implementation
